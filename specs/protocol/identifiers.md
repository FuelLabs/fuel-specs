# Identifiers

- [Transaction ID](#transaction-id)
- [Contract ID](#contract-id)
- [UTXO ID](#utxo-id)
  - [Coin ID](#coin-id)
  - [Deposit ID](#deposit-id)
  - [Fee ID](#fee-id)

This document defines how to compute unique identifiers.

## Transaction ID

The _transaction ID_ (also called _transaction hash_) of a transaction is computed as the [hash](./cryptographic_primitives.md#hashing) of the [serialized transaction](./tx_format.md#transaction) with [fields zeroed out for signing](./tx_format.md) (see different inputs and outputs for which fields are set to zero), and without witness data. In other words, only all non-witness data is hashed.

## Contract ID

For a transaction of type `TransactionType.Create`, `tx`, the contract ID is `sha256(0x4655454C ++ tx.data.salt ++ root(tx.data.witnesses[bytecodeWitnessIndex].data) ++ root_smt(tx.storageSlots))`, where `root` is the Merkle root of [the binary Merkle tree](./cryptographic_primitives.md#binary-merkle-tree) with each leaf being an 8-byte word of two instructions, and `root_smt` is the [Sparse Merkle tree](./cryptographic_primitives.md#sparse-merkle-tree) root of the provided key-value pairs. If the bytecode is not a multiple of 8 bytes (i.e. if there are an odd number of instructions), the last instruction is padded with 4-byte zero.

## UTXO ID

### Coin ID

Is represented as an _outpoint_: a pair of [transaction ID](#transaction-id) as `byte[32]` and output index as a `uint8`.

### Deposit ID

The UTXO ID of a deposit is computed as the [hash](./cryptographic_primitives.md#hashing) of TODO.

### Fee ID

The UTXO ID of collected fees in a block is the block height as a 32-byte big-endian unsigned integer (i.e. the first byte of the 32-byte array is the most significant byte, and so on).
