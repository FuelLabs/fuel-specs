Here's a very short explanation of the Transaction ID calculation in points:

1. **Transaction ID** (also called Transaction Hash).

2. **Components**:
   - `CHAIN_ID`: Network identifier.
   - Serialized transaction data, excluding witnesses.
   - Specific fields zeroed out for signing.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Hash the concatenation of `CHAIN_ID` and the serialized transaction data (without witnesses and with fields zeroed out for signing).

4. **Purpose**:
   - Unique identifier for a transaction.
   - Deterministic, based on transaction data and network.
   - Excludes witnesses and zeroes out fields for signing.

In essence, the Transaction ID is a hash of the blockchain network identifier and the non-witness transaction data, with certain fields zeroed out for signing purposes, providing a unique and deterministic identifier for each transaction.
