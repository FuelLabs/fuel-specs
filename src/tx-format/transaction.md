| `type` | [`TransactionType`](#transaction)                                                                                                                                                                                             | Transaction type. |
| `data` | One of [`TransactionScript`](#transactionscript), [`TransactionCreate`](#transactioncreate), [`TransactionMint`](#transactionmint), [`TransactionUpgrade`](#transactionupgrade), or [`TransactionUpload`](#transactionupload) | Transaction data. |

Given helper `max_gas()` returns the maximum gas that the transaction can use.
Given helper `count_ones()` that returns the number of ones in the binary representation of a field.
Given helper `count_variants()` that returns the number of variants in an enum.
Given helper `sum_variants()` that sums all variants of an enum.

Transaction is invalid if:

- `type` is not valid `TransactionType` value
- `inputsCount > MAX_INPUTS`
- `outputsCount > MAX_OUTPUTS`
- `witnessesCount > MAX_WITNESSES`
- `size > MAX_TRANSACTION_SIZE`. The size of a transaction is calculated as the sum of the sizes of its static and dynamic parts, as determined by canonical serialization.
- No inputs are of type `InputType.Coin` or `InputType.Message` with `input.dataLength` == 0
- More than one output is of type `OutputType.Change` for any asset ID in the input set
- More than one output is of type `OutputType.Change` with identical `asset_id` fields.
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Change` for any asset ID not in the input set
- More than one input of type `InputType.Coin` for any [Coin ID](../identifiers/utxo-id.md#coin-id) in the input set
- More than one input of type `InputType.Contract` for any [Contract ID](../identifiers/utxo-id.md#contract-id) in the input set
- More than one input of type `InputType.Message` for any [Message ID](../identifiers/utxo-id.md#message-id) in the input set
- if `type != TransactionType.Mint`
  - `max_gas(tx) > MAX_GAS_PER_TX`
  - No policy of type `PolicyType.MaxFee` is set
  - `count_ones(policyTypes) > count_variants(PolicyType)`
  - `policyTypes > sum_variants(PolicyType)`
  - `len(policies) > count_ones(policyTypes)`

When serializing a transaction, fields are serialized as follows (with inner structs serialized recursively):

1. `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`: big-endian right-aligned to 8 bytes.
1. `byte[32]`: as-is.
1. `byte[]`: as-is, with padding zeroes aligned to 8 bytes.

When deserializing a transaction, the reverse is done. If there are insufficient bytes or too many bytes, the transaction is invalid.

## `TransactionScript`

```c++
enum ReceiptType : uint8 {
    Call = 0,
    Return = 1,
    ReturnData = 2,
    Panic = 3,
    Revert = 4,
    Log = 5,
    LogData = 6,
    Transfer = 7,
    TransferOut = 8,
    ScriptResult = 9,
    MessageOut = 10,
    Mint = 11,
    Burn = 12,
}
```

Given helper `len()` that returns the number of bytes of a field.

Transaction is invalid if:

- Any output is of type `OutputType.ContractCreated`
- `scriptLength > MAX_SCRIPT_LENGTH`
- `scriptDataLength > MAX_SCRIPT_DATA_LENGTH`
- `scriptLength * 4 != len(script)`
- `scriptDataLength != len(scriptData)`

> **Note:** when signing a transaction, `receiptsRoot` is set to zero.
>
> **Note:** when verifying a predicate or executing a script, `receiptsRoot` is initialized to zero.

The receipts root `receiptsRoot` is the root of the [binary Merkle tree](../protocol/cryptographic-primitives.md#binary-merkle-tree) of receipts. If there are no receipts, its value is set to the root of the empty tree, i.e. `0xe3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855`.

- Any input uses non-base asset.
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Contract` or `OutputType.Variable` or `OutputType.Message`

- The [Sparse Merkle tree](../protocol/cryptographic-primitives.md#sparse-merkle-tree) root of `storageSlots` is not equal to the `stateRoot` of the one `OutputType.ContractCreated` output

Creates a contract with contract ID as computed [here](../identifiers/contract-id.md).

## `TransactionMint`

The transaction is created by the block producer and is not signed. Since it is not usable outside of block creation or execution, all fields must be fully set upon creation without any zeroing.
This means that the transaction ID must also include the correct `txPointer` value, not zeroed out.

| `gasPrice`       | `uint64`                        | The gas price to be used in calculating all fees for transactions on block |

Transaction is invalid if:

- `txPointer` is zero or doesn't match the block.
- `outputContract.inputIndex` is not zero

## `TransactionUpgrade`

The `Upgrade` transaction allows upgrading either consensus parameters or state transition function used by the network to produce future blocks. The `Upgrade Purpose` type defines the purpose of the upgrade.

The `Upgrade` transaction is chargeable, and the sender should pay for it. Transaction inputs should contain only base assets.

Only the privileged address from [`ConsensusParameters`](./consensus_parameters.md) can upgrade the network. The privileged address can be either a real account or a predicate.

When the upgrade type is `UpgradePurposeType.ConsensusParameters` serialized consensus parameters are available in the witnesses and the `Upgrade` transaction is self-contained because it has all the required information.

When the upgrade type is `UpgradePurposeType.StateTransition`, the `bytecodeRoot` field contains the Merkle root of the new bytecode of the state transition function. The bytecode should already be available on the blockchain at the upgrade point; otherwise, the upgrade will fail. The bytecode can be part of the genesis block or can be uploaded via the `TransactionUpload` transaction.

The block header contains information about which versions of consensus parameters and state transition function are used to produce a block, and the `Upgrade` transaction defines behavior corresponding to the version. When the block executes the `Upgrade` transaction, it defines new behavior for either `BlockHeader.consensusParametersVersion + 1` or `BlockHeader.stateTransitionBytecodeVersion + 1`(it depends on the purpose of the upgrade).

When the `Upgrade` transaction is included in the block, it doesn't affect the current block execution. Since behavior is now defined, the inclusion of the `Upgrade` transaction allows the production of the next block with a new version. The block producer can still continue to use the previous version and start using a new version later unless the state transition function forbids it.

The behavior is set once per version. It is forbidden to override the behavior of the network. Each behavior should have its own version. The version should grow monotonically without jumps.

The `BlockHeader.consensusParametersVersion` and `BlockHeader.stateTransitionBytecodeVersion` are independent and can grow at different speeds.

Transaction is invalid if:

- Any input is of type `InputType.Contract` or `InputType.Message` where `input.dataLength > 0`
- Any input uses non-base asset.
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Contract` or `OutputType.Variable` or `OutputType.Message` or `OutputType.ContractCreated`
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Change` with non-base `asset_id`
- No input where `InputType.Message.owner == PRIVILEGED_ADDRESS` or `InputType.Coint.owner == PRIVILEGED_ADDRESS`
- The `UpgradePurpose` is invalid

## `TransactionUpload`

The `Upload` transaction allows the huge bytecode to be divided into subsections and uploaded slowly to the chain. The [Binary Merkle root](../protocol/cryptographic-primitives.md#binary-merkle-tree) built on top of subsections is an identifier of the bytecode.

Each transaction uploads a subsection of the code and must contain proof of connection to the root. All subsections should be uploaded sequentially, which allows the concatenation of previously uploaded subsections with new subsection. The bytecode is considered final when the last subsection is uploaded, and future `Upload` transactions with the same `root` fields should be rejected.

When the bytecode is completed it can be used to upgrade the network.

The size of each subsection can be arbitrary; the only limit is the maximum number of subsections allowed by the network. The combination of the transaction gas limit and the number of subsections limits the final maximum size of the bytecode.

Transaction is invalid if:

- Any input is of type `InputType.Contract` or `InputType.Message` where `input.dataLength > 0`
- Any input uses non-base asset.
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Contract` or `OutputType.Variable` or `OutputType.Message` or `OutputType.ContractCreated`
- Any output is of type `OutputType.Change` with non-base `asset_id`
- `witnessIndex >= tx.witnessesCount`
- `subsectionIndex` >= `subsectionsNumber`
- `subsectionsNumber > MAX_BYTECODE_SUBSECTIONS`
- The [Binary Merkle tree](../protocol/cryptographic-primitives.md#binary-merkle-tree) root calculated from `(witnesses[witnessIndex], subsectionIndex, subsectionsNumber, proofSet)` is not equal to the `root`. Root calculation is affected by all fields, so modification of one of them invalidates the proof.
