# Contract ID

For a transaction of type `TransactionType.Create`, `tx`, the contract ID is `sha256(0x4655454C ++ tx.data.salt ++ root(tx.data.witnesses[bytecodeWitnessIndex].data) ++ root_smt(tx.storageSlots))`, where `root` is the Merkle root of [the binary Merkle tree](../cryptographic_primitives.md#binary-merkle-tree) with each leaf being an 8-byte word of two instructions, and `root_smt` is the [Sparse Merkle tree](../cryptographic_primitives.md#sparse-merkle-tree) root of the provided key-value pairs. If the bytecode is not a multiple of 8 bytes (i.e. if there are an odd number of instructions), the last instruction is padded with 4-byte zero.
